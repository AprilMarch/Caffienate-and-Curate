      <h2>Caffiene-tiere</h2>
      <img src="images/cafetiere.jpg" alt="cafetiere" width=50% />
      <p><strong>Lots</strong> of people have <strong>lots</strong> of opinions about how to make cafetiere coffee. Here are my instructions for making a decent cup of coffee:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Boil the kettle. Use the first lot of water to start warming up your cafetiere and cup. Put the hot water into your vessels for <em>ideally</em> about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Boil the kettle again. Once it has boiled, let it sit for 1-2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, our out the water from the cafetiere and add your coffee grounds. Use 1 tbsp per cup. Use coarse grounds. </li>
        <li>Add the hot (not boiling - you don't want to scold the grounds) to the cafetiere. To add, pour it onto the sides of the cafetiere in a circular motion. Stir, and put the top on. </li>
        <li>After 2 minutes, stir again. </li>
        <li>After another 2 minutes (total time = 4 mins) stir again, then plunge it. Enjoy your coffee!</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>My favourite brewing method</h2>
      <img src="images/moka pot.jpg" alt="Moka Pot" width=50% />
      <p> I am not alive until I have had my morning 2-cup Moka pot in the morning. blah blah blah blah... <br> ...And, of course, to do justice to a delightfuli brewing method, your choice of coffee grounds is critical! This early in the morning I can't stand the idea of noisily grinding my own beans so I use pre-ground coffee. For a stove-top perculator like this you need a fine-medium grind. Too often, packs of coffee in the supermarket won't tell you their coarseness so I tend not to be very adventurous in my coffee-grind purchases for my moka pot coffee. Too fine or too coarse a grind will result in a gritty bottom to your coffee! <em>...ew...</em><br>My preference is one I can always rely on being on the shelves - even in the little Tesco here, and is on offer at least 50% of the time: the red and silver Lavazza. <br><br> Ooh, and I should also mention: it's not just the coffee that I like, but it is very <em>satisfying</em> to watch it brew. It's like a volcano! ...Sounds weird, I realise - but if you see, you'd totally understand! </p>
      <img src="images/lavazza.jpg" alt="Lavazza" width=50% />
      <h5>Here are my instructions for making the perfect volcanic brew:</h5>
      <ol>
        <li>Boil the kettle. And suitably fill the bottom part of the pot. Don't over fill it though! The water doesn't have to be boiling, just hot. This will make the brewing process a little quicker and result in a slightly less bitter-tasting brew.</li>
        <li>With the left-over hot water, fill your mug to warm it though. This will help keep your cup of coffee hot - especially useful if you are the kind of person who likes to enjoy drinking over duration!</li>
        <li>Place in that middle cup, and fill (not necessarily to the top) with your selected coffee grounds. Remember to get the grind right!</li>
        <li>Screw on the top of the pot (careful, it will be hot! I usually use a tea towel to hold it at this stage) and put it on the hob</li>
        <li>Be patient and listen.</li>
        <li>As soon as you here bubbling coming from the pot, turn it off.</li>
        <li>Et voila - enjoy your coffee!</li>
      </ol>
      <p>You now have a choice of how to drink your coffee. In the mornings I prefer to have a longer drink - I have my moka pot cappucino-style with frothed milk and chocolate dust (<em>bougie</em>, I know). Alternatively, if you don't want to drink it straight, I'd recommend either adding a splash of milk or making it into an almost-americano by adding hot water. </p>
